# ARTI – Machine Learning

This repository is created for the **Machine Learning** course.  

## About Me
Hi! My name is **Nabaa Alaswad**.  
I am an **Artificial Intelligence student**.

I enjoy learning how machine learning models work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems using data.
I am particularly interested in learning about different types of machine learning and how to apply various techniques to effectively solve practical problems.

Looking forward to learning and building more throughout this course :)
